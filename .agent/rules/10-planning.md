# Planning Phase Rules

**Bias for Action**: Planning should not exceed 20% of total task time.

When designing or planning:

1. **Read First**: ARCHITECTURE_SSOT.md and relevant ADRs
2. **Research Fast**: Search ≥3 sources, decide quickly if they agree
3. **Document**: Create concise plans with clear next steps
4. **Validate**: Aligns with SSOT §3.5 priorities? Respects kill switches?

## Output Artifacts

- **Concise** implementation plans (1 page max for most features)
- Quick trade-off analysis for major decisions
- ADRs only for decisions likely to be revisited

## Anti-Patterns

- **Analysis Paralysis**: If 3 credible sources agree, implement
- Ignoring existing working patterns
- Over-engineering before proving profitability
- Planning refactors before the component works
