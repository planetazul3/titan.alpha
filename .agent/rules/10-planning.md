# Planning Phase Rules

When designing or planning:

1. **Read First**: ARCHITECTURE_SSOT.md and relevant ADRs
2. **Research**: Search for best practices before deciding
3. **Document**: Create implementation plans, not just code
4. **Validate**: Does this align with SSOT? Respect safety vetoes?

## Output Artifacts

- Implementation plans with clear steps
- Trade-off analysis for significant decisions
- ADRs for architectural choices that may be revisited

## Anti-Patterns

- Jumping straight to code without understanding
- Ignoring existing patterns in the codebase
- Reinventing what already exists
